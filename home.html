    <p><br>Batman is a fictional comic character created by
    artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger. Batman first appeared
    in American comic books published by DC Comics and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939.
    In the name of his murdered parents, Bruce Wayne wages eternal war on the criminals of Gotham City. He is vengeance. He is the night. 
    He is Batman.A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayneâ€™s double life affords him the comfort of a life without financial worry, 
    a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath his family's sprawling 
    estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, 
    es and rooftops of Gotham City.

    One of the most iconic fictional characters in the world, Batman has dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a war on all 
    criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was just a child. Since that tragic night, he 
    has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super Hero. He's developed an arsenal of technology 
    that would put most armies to shame. <br>
    And he's assembled teams of his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman, Incorporated.</p>

        <p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of 
          his parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice 
          against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts 
          suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne 
          Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate.[71][72] He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, 
          which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it, but is more widely known as a 
          celebrity socialite.[73] In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid 
          gossip while feigning near-drunkenness with consuming large quantities of disguised ginger ale since Wayne is actually a
          strict teetotaler to maintain his physical and mental prowess.[74] Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, 
          his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time.</p>
